# Adventure Time Wisdom

**Live [here](https://adventure-time-wisdom.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku!** ðŸ’–

## Introduction

A small Vue app which displays meaningful quotes from one of my favorite childhood cartoons, *Adventure Time*.

The usage is simple. The page will display results of the Characters API from [Adventure Time API](https://github.com/sally/adventure-time-api) as cards. Each card will have the character's sprite and a random quote.

The random quote can be rerolled by pressing the "More (character name) wisdom?" button on each card.
